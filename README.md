Github Search User
It is a simple Github search user repository website created using HTML, CSS, Javascript and small portion uses bootstrap as well.
User can simply enter their github username to see anyone's repositories & their profile details.
When the user enter the username and hit tthe search user button, they will be redirected to the new page which will show the profile and repositories of the person whose username has been searched.
Also, I have implemented a loader which is used when the Api is getting fetched.
There is a search repository input bar in the repository page , where you can search any repository from the fetched repositories of the user.
